Outside of school, she has privately studied classical voice for over three years and hopes to earn an undergraduate degrees in Vocal Performance in the next four years.

                    <h3>Jamie Tofano</h3>
					<blockquote>My name is Jamie Tofano, and I am a 17 year old senior at Northern Highlands Regional High School. I have loved music for as long as I can remember. I started singing at a very early age, picked up classical piano at the age of four, and now write music on my own. I was part of our schools all-girl a cappella group “Belles”, and it is now my third year being a member of the Highlands Voices where I sing as an Alto 2, and occasionally step in as vocal percussionist. I won outstanding soloist alongside Tricia Wilson in last year’s ICHSA competition, and derive great joy in being part of such an outstanding group. Personally, I am outgoing, loud, funny, and a silly individual and I can often be found cracking jokes. I’m grateful that I have been able to find an outlet like the Highlands Voices, and in this last year with the friends I’ve made, I hope we accomplish an immense amount and grow even closer than we already are.
